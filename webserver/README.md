# CaBr2 Webserver

This is the CaBr2 REST webserver.
It is a complete implementation of the CaBr2 logic as REST API for use in the web app and possible mobile apps.

In the `src/impl` folder there is the glue code for the CaBr2 logic.

The webserver is written in rust with [`warp`](https://lib.rs/crates/warp).
